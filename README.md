- 👋 Hi, I’m @JotaDeRodriguez

- 👀 Designer by trade, I’m interested in exploring the world of computer vision, particularly in Structure from Motion, leveraging technologies like image recognition, machine learning algorithms, and real-time object detection. I'm also keen on integrating these technologies into practical applications that combine in the field of Design, Architecture and Interaction.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in deep learning and neural networks, with a special focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). I’m also diving into various computer vision libraries and frameworks like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, to deepen my understanding and skills in this field.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that leverage computer vision technologies to solve real-world problems, particularly those that require innovative approaches to semantic reconstruction from image, video and pointcloud analisis.
